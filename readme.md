# DAY-2
## Problem Statement: Student Performance Indicator
#### Dataset: 
![alt text](image-2.png)
#### Why choose this project:
#### We will be finding Features of Every type, i.e Categorical features, Numerical Features, NaN values, multiple things
#### We will get to know how we can solve the Feature Engineering
#### Till now we have created models in Jupyter Notebook, Now we are going tp write those as modular code
### Will get to learn about EDA

# DAY-3
## Data Ingestion:
#### In projects, there will be Big Data Team, their job is to collect the datas (huge volume of datas) adn store it in Hadoop or  Database, example MongoDB
#### Its the Job of DataScientists is, to first Read the Datas from the Data Storing Source, Split the Data into Train Test Split
#### After that DAta Trasnformatiom will happen

# DAY- 4
## Data Transformation:
#### The main purose of this phase is Feature Engineering, Data Cleaning, Converting Characteritical Features to Numerical Features

# DAY-5
## Model Training:
### The output from model transformation, i.e the train array and test array is given as input to model trainer
### Inside model trainer, the test train datasplit is done .
### Models are stored as dictonary, and each model is trained with the test and train ds. The model with Best test accuracy model is stored as .pkl file
