# DAY-3
## Data Ingestion:
#### In projects, there will be Big Data Team, their job is to collect the datas (huge volume of datas) adn store it in Hadoop or  Database, example MongoDB
#### Its the Job of DataScientists is, to first Read the Datas from the Data Storing Source, Split the Data into Train Test Split
#### After that DAta Trasnformatiom will happen
